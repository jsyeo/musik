<sup>_IDK Feeling Hacky, Might Delete Later_</sup>

Some random scripts that I wrote to experiment with the things in this blog
post: https://zserge.com/posts/etude-in-c/.

I rewrote some of the snippets in ruby to understand it further using ruby's
lazy enumerators. In my opinion, lazy enumerators are more well suited to
create an oscilating stream of bytes. They fit the mental model of a infinite
stream of bytes better.

In addition to the sawtooth waveform, I also experimented with making chords by
adding the waves.
